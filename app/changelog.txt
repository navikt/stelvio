STELVIO CHANGELOG
=================
http://confluence.adeo.no/display/stelvio/Architecture

Changes in version 1.0.1 (17.1.2007)
------------------------------------

General
* Added module stelvio-star-example which will hold a complete example of an implementation of a JEE application based
  on the Stelvio application architecture
* Added module stelvio-service-java
* Added module stelvio-repository-java

Module stelvio-common-java
* Added configuration (using the configuration mechanism defined by the JAR file service provider contract in JDK 1.3
  and above) in META-INF/services/org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory to make sure commons-logging is using an
  application's log4j.properties and not Websphere's own
* Removed remnants of rtv-framework
* Refactored the 2 aspects of RequestContext, current thread handling and data container, into 2 new classes
  * RequestContext -> plain POJO holding specific values, like user id, screen id, etc
  * RequestContextHolder -> holds a RequestContext on the current thread
* Simplified transfer object support
  * No need for Entity(List)Response
  * No need for interfaces
  * 2 concrete classes, ServiceRequest and ServiceResponse, are left -> should be extended by transfer objects
* Cleaned up codes table code
  * Removed deprecated methods
  * Added getItems() on CodesTablePeriodic so the interface is equal to CodesTable
  * Improved documentation of which exceptions are thrown 
* Improved naming and structure of Error package
* No need to implement a constructor only used by Stelvio when removing cause; reflection is used instead
