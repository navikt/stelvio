/**
 * Interface to be implemented by Enums that represent Codes in CodesTables that have

 * 
 * <p>
 * An example of an Enum that can't directly represent a codestable code is the enum
 * for postal code (zip code). The enum instance Postnr.0116 is illegal. By implementing
 * this interface and returning the code in getIllegalCode, the actual name of the
 * Enum instance can be anything. (IE: Postnr.P0116)
