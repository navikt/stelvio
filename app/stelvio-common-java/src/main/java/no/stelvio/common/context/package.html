		Request Context Framework.
		Request context is a temporary storage available on current thread, and is usually used for
		accessing variables and objects specific to the user, system, process or transaction executing current thread.
		<p/>
		The request context framework is implemented in a pluggable fashion which allows the framework
		to be easily extended with new plugins.
		<p/>
		Log4jContextImpl is the default plugin, and is loaded automatically if
		the Jakarta Log4j library is present in the classpath.
