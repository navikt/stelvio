 * Defines MDC property keys than can be used by log4j to log additional context data to a log entry. See {@link MDC}. Log4J
 * loggers can use these properties to set corresponding values. If the MDC properties are set with values, log4j can be
 * configured to include them in the logs by specifying the <code>ConversionPattern</code> on the layout. Example:
 * <code>[appender].layout.ConversionPattern=... %X{user}... </code>
