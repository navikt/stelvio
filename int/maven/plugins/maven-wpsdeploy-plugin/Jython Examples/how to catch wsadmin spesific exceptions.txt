Hi,

I too had faced similar kind of problem. I had tried the following sequence of steps and it seemed to handle WAS exceptions

1. In the jython script, import the WAS exception that you wish to handle

from com.ibm.websphere.management.exception import AdminException


2. Altering the try-except block to catch the exception

try:
    AdminControl.someFunc()
except AdminException, msg:
    print "caught the exception:" , msg


3. In the wsadmin script execution statement add option -wsadmin_classpath "<WAS INSTALL PATH>\deploytool\itp\plugins\com.ibm.websphere.v61_6.1.0\ws_runtime.jar" as in the example below...
Note: The directory "com.ibm.websphere.v61_6.1.0" is specific to the version that is installed, hence substitute accordingly

wsadmin -lang jython -wsadmin_classpath "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer1\deploytool\itp\plugins\com.ibm.websphere.v61_6.1.0\ws_runtime.jar" -f C:\SampScript.py


If you had any other means of resolving this issue, pls post them too 

Cheers,
Krish
